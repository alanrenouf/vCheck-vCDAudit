vCheck-vCDAudit
===============

vCheck Audit version for VMware vCloud Director (vCD)

vCheck is a PowerShell HTML framework script, the script is designed to run as a scheduled task before you get into the office to present you with key information via an email directly to your inbox in a nice easily readable format.

Unlike the vSphere health check script this is an audit script which retrieves and presents key vCD Data which is otherwise hard to find in a centralized place.
